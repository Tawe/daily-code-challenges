## Instructions
You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`​​​.

A **rhombus sum** is the sum of the elements that form **the** **border** of a regular rhombus shape in `grid`​​​. The rhombus must have the shape of a square rotated 45 degrees with each of the corners centered in a grid cell. Below is an image of four valid rhombus shapes with the corresponding colored cells that should be included in each **rhombus sum**:

Note that the rhombus can have an area of 0, which is depicted by the purple rhombus in the bottom right corner.

Return _the biggest three **distinct rhombus sums** in the_ `grid` _in **descending order**__. If there are less than three distinct values, return all of them_.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/23/pc73-q4-ex1.png)

**Input:** grid = [[3,4,5,1,3],[3,3,4,2,3],[20,30,200,40,10],[1,5,5,4,1],[4,3,2,2,5]]
**Output:** [228,216,211]
**Explanation:** The rhombus shapes for the three biggest distinct rhombus sums are depicted above.
- Blue: 20 + 3 + 200 + 5 = 228
- Red: 200 + 2 + 10 + 4 = 216
- Green: 5 + 200 + 4 + 2 = 211

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
**Output:** [20,9,8]
**Explanation:** The rhombus shapes for the three biggest distinct rhombus sums are depicted above.
- Blue: 4 + 2 + 6 + 8 = 20
- Red: 9 (area 0 rhombus in the bottom right corner)
- Green: 8 (area 0 rhombus in the bottom middle)

**Example 3:**

**Input:** grid = [[7,7,7]]
**Output:** [7]
**Explanation:** All three possible rhombus sums are the same, so return [7].

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 105`

## My Thoughts

I handled this by explicitly enumerating all valid rhombuses and tracking distinct border sums in a set.

Approach:

- add all single-cell values first (area-0 rhombuses)
- for every possible top vertex `(r, c)`, try increasing sizes `s`
- stop when any of the four rhombus vertices goes out of bounds
- for each valid `(r, c, s)`, walk the 4 border edges and sum visited cells
- store each sum in a `set`/map for uniqueness

After collecting all distinct sums:

- convert the set to a list
- sort descending
- return first 3 (or fewer if not enough distinct values)

Because `m, n <= 50`, this direct border-walk method is fast enough and straightforward to verify.

Time complexity: `O(m * n * k^2)` where `k = min(m, n)`  
Space complexity: `O(u)` for distinct sums (`u` = number of unique rhombus sums)

## What I Learned

- Geometry-on-grid problems become manageable when parameterized by a fixed anchor and size.
- Validating boundary conditions up front simplifies the border traversal logic.
- Keeping sums in a set is the cleanest way to satisfy “distinct values” requirements.
- For small constraints, a clear brute-force enumeration can be better than over-optimizing with complex prefix-diagonal math.
