## Instructions
Extension Extractor
Given a string representing a filename, return the extension of the file.

The extension is the part of the filename that comes after the last period (.).
If the filename does not contain a period or ends with a period, return "none".
The extension should be returned as-is, preserving case.

## My Thoughts
I need to convert the string into an array and remove the last element, check if it not empty and if parts is larger then one element. If so return the last part if not return none


## What I Learned
Not much this was easy
