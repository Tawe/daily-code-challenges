## Instructions
AI Detector
Today's challenge is inspired by the release of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022.

Given a string of one or more sentences, determine if it was likely generated by AI using the following rules:

- It contains two or more dashes (-).
- It contains two or more sets of parenthesis (()). Text can be within the parenthesis.
- It contains three or more words with 7 or more letters.
- Words are separated by a single space and only consist of letters (A-Z). Don't include punctuation or other non-letters as part of a word.

If the given sentence meets any of the rules above, return "AI", otherwise, return "Human".

## My Thoughts

This challenge looked simple on the surface just detect whether a string looks "AI-generated" based on a few rules. But implementing those rules correctly turned out to be surprisingly nuanced. The tricky part wasn’t regex itself, but translating the problem statement into behavior that matches real examples.

The biggest lesson was that the rules had subtle edges that a straightforward interpretation would miss. For example, counting long words isn’t as simple as splitting on spaces; punctuation breaks tokens, and contractions or symbols aren’t considered valid words. Similarly, identifying two parenthesis groups requires actually finding (...) patterns, not just counting parentheses, and counting dashes isn't just "does it contain a dash" it’s specifically "two or more."

Once I stepped back and rewrote the rules in plain English—using the test cases as reality checks it became clear what the function truly needed to detect. That gave me the confidence to simplify the implementation: match sequences of letters as words, count long words, count real parenthesis groups, count dashes directly, and let the rules drive the final classification.

The final result ended up being clean, readable, and makes sense logically it aligns perfectly with the example outputs, which is the real goal.

## My thoughts

- The challenge wasn’t about advanced regex, it was about interpreting natural language rules precisely.
- Counting long words requires extracting [A-Za-z]+ sequences, not just splitting text on spaces.
- Parenthesis detection must identify full groups like (text), not individual parentheses.
- Some rules are “absolute triggers”:
    - Two or more dashes → immediately AI
    - Two or more parenthesis groups → immediately AI
    - Three or more long words → immediately AI
- Regex is powerful, but mixing counting logic and regex leads to confusion. The cleanest solution uses regex only for extraction, and JavaScript for counting.
- Test cases are the source of truth. If the interpretation of the rules and the expected outputs disagree, assume the examples show the real intended behavior.
