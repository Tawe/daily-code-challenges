## Instructions

In this challenge, you are given a string and need to determine if it fits in a social media post. Return the following strings based on the rules given:
- "short post" if it fits within a 40-character limit
- "long post" if it's greater than 40 characters and fits within an 80-character limit
- "invalid post" if it's too long to fit within either limit

## My Thoughts

This should be pretty simple. We will have a circuit breaker return if greater then 80 and then a ternary to check if greater then 40.

## What I Learned

Not a ton. This was very easy.
