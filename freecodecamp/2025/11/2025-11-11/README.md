## Instructions

Vowels and Consonants
Given a string, return an array with the number of vowels and number of consonants in the string.
Vowels consist of a, e, i, o, u in any case.
Consonants consist of all other letters in any case.
Ignore any non-letter characters.
For example, given "Hello World", return [3, 7].

## My Thoughts

This should be fairly easy we just need to traverse an array of letters and see if they are in an array of vowels if not add to the const side of our count array. We need to regex for non-letters
