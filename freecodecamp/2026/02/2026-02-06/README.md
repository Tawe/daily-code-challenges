## Instructions

2026 Winter Games Day 1: Opening Day
Today marks the start of the 2026 Winter Games. The next 17 days will bring you coding challenges inspired by them.

## My Thoughts

This challenge felt straightforward at first, but it quickly turned into an exercise in discipline and completeness rather than clever logic. There wasn’t a trick or algorithm to discover — the real work was carefully mapping each country code to the correct emoji and making sure nothing was missing or mistyped. I found myself double-checking spelling, ordering, and consistency more than thinking about code structure. It was a reminder that not every problem rewards abstraction or optimization; sometimes the safest, clearest solution is a direct lookup table. I also noticed that this kind of problem punishes shortcuts. Trying to “generate” flags dynamically would have been risky or unclear given the constraints. Writing it out explicitly made the behavior obvious and predictable. By the end, it felt less like solving a puzzle and more like building a reliable reference.

## What I Learned

- Not all coding challenges are about algorithms, some are about accuracy and reliability.
- A plain object / dictionary lookup is often the clearest solution.
- Readability matters: future readers instantly understand what the function does.
- Defensive defaults (|| "") help keep functions safe and predictable.
- Sometimes “boring code” is the best code.
- Taking time to be precise is just as important as being clever.
